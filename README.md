# socket.io-Chat_App-With_Rooms

### This app is a new version of the old app( if you want to see the old version click <a href='https://github.com/ihebXxxjaouadi/socket.io-Chat-App'>Here</a> ). I added the rooms feature to it, you can choose a room to chat in and each room is separate from the other rooms.

## after you pulled the project. you have to enter this http request "http://localhost:3000/room" on your browser.

<hr/>

## 1. You need to choose a room to begin chatting
